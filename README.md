# dinner-dash

Automatic creation of food plans, based on saved recipes.

## Purpose

Are you tired of always asking yourself the question: "What should we have for dinner tonight?". Are you tired of having to go buy groceries multiple times a week, because you don't know what you are going to make for dinner throughout the week?

Dinner dash is the fix to that. The purpose of dinner dash is to provide a platform where you can save recipes, and be provided with meal plans for a week, which will specify what recipes to cook as well as what groceries to buy, in order to be able to cook the meals.

## Technology stack

The backend will be built using the Go programming langauge. The database used will be PostgreSQL.
The backend will be a set of APIs that can be called from the frontend, in order to perform various actions in the system.

The frontend will be built using either Angular og Vue.js. That has yet to be decided. It will connect to the backend API, which means the frontend and backend will be loosely coupled and only tied together by HTTP calls to the API.
Nginx will most likely be used to serve the static HTML/CSS/JS files.
